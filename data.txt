league's top 100 players. What can we expect from the game's best players?</p><p>We asked a panel of 46 ESPN NFL experts to rate players based on how good they will be in the 2020 season in comparison to their peers. Emphasis was entirely on expectations for the upcoming season -- that means <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/29774920/source-los-angeles-chargers-s-derwin-james-injures-knee">injured safety Derwin James</a> won't make the list -- and predicting potential greatness, rather than past performance, career résumé or positional value.

Age: 24<br />
2019 rank: 2</b></p><p>Over the past two seasons, Mahomes was No. 1 in many key stat categories including QBR (79). And at 24 years old, he should only continue to get better. Plus, the Chiefs gave him yet another high-end offensive asset in the draft when they took running back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242214/clyde-edwards-helaire">Clyde Edwards-Helaire</a> in the first round. <em>-- Adam Teicher</em></p><p><b>Signature stat:</b> He has played 36 games in his career, including the postseason, and never lost by more than one score or posted a Total QBR below 50 in a game. In other words, Mahomes has never had a below-average game. It's by far the most consecutive games with a QBR of 50 or greater to start a career since the metric was first calculated in 2006.</p><p><b>What they are saying:</b> "If there was ever a player that was truly deserving of the largest contract in U.S. sports history, it's definitely Pat Mahomes." <em>-- Brett Veach, Chiefs GM</em></p><p><b><a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections">2020 projection</a>:</b> 4,477 passing yards, 33 TDs, 10 INT (281 rushing yards)</p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20160725_mlbrankfuture/greyline.png" width="100%"><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2020/0822/r734795_400x600_2-3.jpg"><h2>2. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16716/aaron-donald">Aaron Donald</a></h2><p><b>DT | <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams">Rams</a><br />
Age: 29<br />
2019 rank: 1</b></p><p>Donald declared, heading into his seventh NFL season at 29 years old, that he feels like he's in better shape than ever before. The two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year led all interior linemen last season with a pass rush win rate of 24.5%, and that could still increase in 2020 if new defensive coordinator Brandon Staley's scheme goes as planned. Staley has made it his mission to get Donald, who absorbs among the most double-teams of any lineman in the NFL, into more one-on-one situations. <em>-- Lindsey Thiry</em></p><p><b>Signature stat:</b> Over the past three seasons, Donald has recorded the first pressure on 175 plays. The next-highest total by an interior lineman in that span is 99 (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14941/fletcher-cox">Fletcher Cox</a>). For context, the difference between Donald and Cox in that time frame is the same as the difference between Cox and the players tied for 53rd.</p><p><b>What they are saying:</b> "It just shows up every day how hard he works in practice, how hard he works in the weight room, how hard he studies film. It truly makes everyone else bring their level up higher when they see the best player on the field, arguably the best player in this league, working as hard as he does every day. I expect him to have another Defensive Player of the Year type of year." <em>-- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff">Jared Goff</a>, Rams quarterback</em></p><p><b><a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/projections">2020 projection</a>:</b> 49 tackles, 10 sacks, 2 forced fumbles</p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20160725_mlbrankfuture/greyline.png" width="100%"><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2020/0822/r734796_400x600_2-3.jpg"><h2>3. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a></h2><p><b>QB | <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens">Ravens</a><br />
Age: 23<br />
2019 rank: NR</b></p><p>Jackson became the second unanimous NFL MVP after leading the league with 36 touchdown passes and setting the single-season mark for rushing yards by a quarterback with 1,206. What's scary is he still can make strides as a passer, especially on downfield throws. Could Jackson follow <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a>' path by capturing a Super Bowl a year after winning MVP? <em>-- Jamison Hensley</em></p><p><b>Signature stat:</b> Jackson posted a 91.0 Total QBR when facing man coverage last season, the highest in the four seasons in which that data has been tracked (NFL Next Gen Stats). His 25 touchdowns against such coverage were also the most by anyone with one or no interceptions in that same span.</p><p><b>What they are saying:</b> "He's the best player I've ever been around, and he works hard. So, I think you are going to see an even more polished and an even more ready Lamar than you saw last year.

The Seahawks have the speed at wide receiver to complement what might be their quarterback's biggest strength: throwing the deep ball.

Wilson's durability and his recent MVP-level trajectory, plus the potential for more explosive plays, set him up for a strong 2020 season. <em>-- Brady Henderson</em></p><p><b>Signature stat:</b> Last season, Wilson's 6.2 TD-INT ratio was the second highest of any player who was sacked at least 40 times in a single season (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a>, 12.5 in 2018).</p><p><b>What they are saying:</b> "He works harder than anybody I know.

But Thomas has that total through four seasons.</p><p><b>What they are saying:</b> "His level of preparation, intensity, expectation level and just how he approaches each and every day and each and every game [stand out].

That's why the Panthers are building around him and why they gave him an extension that made him the highest-paid back ($16 million per year) in the league. Beyond talent, he has the work ethic new coach Matt Rhule wants the rest of his team to replicate. He's as complete a player as there is in the league. <em>-- David Newton</em></p><p><b>Signature stat:</b> McCaffrey is the only player in NFL history with at least 2,500 rushing and receiving yards each over his first three NFL seasons.</p><p><b>What they are saying:</b> "I don't look at Christian as just a running back. We see him as a weapon. We see him as a person that can be a receiver, a running back, a returner. As important as anything else is, the true leader [he is] on the team, and he does everything the right way.

He's a 1,000-yard machine, hitting the number in five of his seven seasons, including 1,165 receiving yards last season and another 208 in two playoff games.
